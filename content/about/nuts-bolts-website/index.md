Have you ever came across some personal blogging site and wondered, <br> 
 - How they built it?
 - What software/platform they used?
 
I always had those questions. If you too, then you are at the right page for this website.

- This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an awesome open-source static site generator. Big **kudos** to the team/community who built this. :folded_hands:
- The custom Hugo theme used is [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo). Thanks to **James Panther**, the author of this theme. :folded_hands:
- All the contents are written in simple [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
